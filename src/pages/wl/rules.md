# Weakest Link Rules
## Format
Complete teams will consist of 4-5 players.

### Preliminaries:
- Swiss Pools
- Each pool has a maximum of 16 teams.
- Teams are evenly distributed across pools.
- 4 Rounds
- PA3

### Finals:
- Single Elimination - No 3rd place match.
- At least 1 team per pool will make finals, with a minimum of 4 teams total.
- BO5

## Timing & Round Duration
- The first round of the day goes for 45 minutes.
- All other preliminary matches will go for 40 minutes.
- There is no time limit on the finals.
- After the round has completed, any unreported games will automatically be reported as a draw.
- If you finish a round early, you must wait for the next round to begin.

## Subs
### As a 3-player team
3-player teams can sign up with an extra player on their team (4 players total). This player cannot substitute for the Weakest Link.

If your FA is consistently unable to practice in-game, you can request 1 replacement 3 days after teams are released, up to 24 hours before tournament day.
There is no guaranteed your request will be fulfilled.

After this point, If your FA is unavailable, an emergency sub is not allowed and you will be forced to forfeit.

If a FA has requested to replace your team, your team will be removed from the tournament and marked as a dropout (See **[Dropouts](#dropouts)**).

### As a FA
If there are more FA’s than teams, extra FA’s will be marked as FA subs and may be assigned to teams up to 24 hours before tournament day.

If your team is consistently acting disrespectful towards you, you can request 1 replacement 3 days after teams are released, up to 24 hours before tournament day. There is no guaranteed your request will be fulfilled.

If a team has requested to replace you, you will be removed from the tournament and marked as a dropout (See **[Dropouts](#dropouts)**).

## DC's Redo Decision Rules
### Redo the match if:
- The team with the DC stops playing and allows the other team to KO.
- The team with the DC stays inside their spawn barrier.
- The team with the DC uses the same weapons/gear shown in the results screen.

### Do NOT redo the match if:
- **Any player** on the same team DC's again in the same round.
- The same player DC's again **any other time** in the tournament.
- The host DC's.
- The match has passed 2:30 before the DC'ing team has forfeited.
- The team without a DC has 50 or less objective remaining (excluding penalty).

If either 2 DC’s occur in the same lobby or the host DC’s, the team currently not hosting must host a new lobby.

To reduce the chances of a dc happening, please check you have a good internet connection with low ping and/or have a LAN adapter for a smoother experience. If not, consider switching hosts.

If there's are complaints about lag from at least 3 people on the same team or 1 person from each team, teams are required to switch hosts to someone on the opposing team.

## Dropouts
For everyone's sake, ***please*** do not drop out.

A dropout occurs when either the Weakest Link or the 3-player team (as a whole) refuses to play after teams are created, for whatever reason.

### If you dropout:
- You will not be able to play in the next month **and** season of Weakest Link.
- You will not receive any Signal Strength for the tournament.

### If the FA/team you are paired with drops out:
- Unfortunately, due to the nature of this tournament, you will not be able to compete anymore.

## Cheating
Forms of cheating include, but are not limited to, playing under false names, bracket manipulation, providing false information in your profile / on smash.gg, anything considered cheating by Nintendo, and failure to comply with any of the rules on this document.

If you cheat:

- Instant disqualification from the tournament.
- A permanent ban from Off the Dial and all tournaments.

This is a strict no-chances policy, and we do not make exceptions to this.

## Other Rules
- All rules are subject to change between seasons, please make sure you read the rules each season before entering.
- By registering you agree to abide by our [terms and conditions](/legal)
