<Title title="Off the Dial Bot">
  Our custom made bot that assists with tournament management and other things also.
</Title>

## Purpose
One of the main purposes of the bot is to automate tedious tournament managing tasks. For example...

- Automatically synchronize the <Mention>Signed Up!</Mention> role with those that have properly signed up.
- Easily view profile and signup data for a user.
- Automatically generate a maplist with the right amount of rounds and games, given a map pool.
- Quickly remove and substitute competitors.
- Automatically distribute Signal Strength properly to all competitors.
- Easily export all signups with both site and smash.gg data.

That's not all however, Off the Dial bot can also...

- Fuzzy search questions on the [FAQ](/faq) with `$faq`
- Embed sections of a Tournament Rules page for easy reference with `$rules`.
- Allow users to give themselves the <Mention>@LF:</Mention> role with `$lf`.
- Generate minesweepers with `$minesweeper`!

## Usage
To view all avaliable commands, type `$help` in the <Mention>#bot-commands</Mention> channel. You can also append the name of any command for more detailed help.

All directions are in the embed, to navigate the commands, simply read the bot message! If you're still stuck, you can ask for help in <Mention>#helpdesk</Mention>.

This lets us track all of the suggestions and reports permanently in one place, as opposed to the <Mention>#suggestions</Mention> channel, where the messages can get easily lost.
