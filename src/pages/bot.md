- Automatically synchronize the <span class="mention">Signed Up!</span> role with those that have properly signed up.
- Easily view profile and signup data for a user.
- Automatically generate a maplist with the right amount of rounds and games, given a map pool.
- Quickly remove and substitute competitors.
- Automatically distribute Signal Strength properly to all competitors.
- Easily export all signups with both site and smash.gg data.

That's not all however, Off the Dial bot can also...

- Fuzzy search questions on the [FAQ](/faq) with `$faq`
- Embed sections of a Tournament Rules page for easy reference with `$rules`.
- Allow users to give themselves the <span class="mention">@LF:</span> role with `$lf`.
- Generate minesweepers with `$minesweeper`!

All directions are in the embed, to navigate the commands, simply read the bot message! If you're still stuck, you can ask for help in <span class="mention">#helpdesk</span>.
