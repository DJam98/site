I'm the main streamer and commentator for Off the Dial.

I've been streaming since 2018 and hosts a weekly on-stream 1v1
Splatoon tournaments. In the last two years I have participated in
several Splatoon LANs around the United States.

Outside of streaming Splatoon and a few other Nintendo Switch
games, I serve on two boards of directors and works full-time as
an information technology manager.
