Hey there! I'm DJam98 and I am the creator of this little Discord
server on the internet.

I spend most of my spare time on Off the Dial and playing games on
the Switch (and spending way too much time in Splatoon).

I have a Twitter, if you want to check that out, where I sometimes
post upcoming updates that may be coming to the server and
tournaments. Follows appreciated!
