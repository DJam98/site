You may know me for my work on the open-sourced Off the Dial Bot and Site.
I've saved DJam98 lots of headaches, and made it much
easier to track ranks, manage profiles, and generate
minesweepers at your convenience.

I'm currently a junior software developer, working on many
different side projects. Including the bot, this site, and many
other things.

If you're curious who I am, check out my website!
