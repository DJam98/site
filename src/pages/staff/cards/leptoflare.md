You may know me as the rewriter of Off the Dial Bot, and my decision to make it open-sourced. I've saved DJam98 lots of headaches, and made it much easier to track ranks, manage profiles, and generate minesweepers at your convenience.

I'm currently a junior software developer, working on many different side projects. Including the bot, this site, and many other things.
