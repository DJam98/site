changelog:
  - Adjustments have been made to ELO calculations
  - Added 'overview', 'lobby settings', 'host dc' and 'teams' sections to the rules (most notable addition being that team names must be under 25 characters, and there are different rules if the host DCs)
  - Modified ending the game early rules, allowing for some leeway if the match was ended early
