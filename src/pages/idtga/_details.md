Happy New Year!

Welcome to 2022, and with the new year brings some fresh updates! This includes a new signup page, with the biggest change being the removal of the smash.gg embed. You no longer have to register on smash.gg to play in the tournament. Instead, you insert your smash.gg user slug and then we'll add everyone to the smash.gg page in bulk after check in closes.

Within the coming weeks, you'll hear more about our 4th anniversary which will arrive in February, but for now, relax, and signup for this season of It's Dangerous to go Alone!

Changes with the signup page!
- You now just need to insert your peak rank, rather than each individual rank
- Instead of using the sliders to configure your play-style, you can enter in your weapons directly
- Competitive experience now allows you to enter in all of your achievements
- The smash.gg embed has been removed. However, you will still need to insert your user slug.

Until Next Time,
Stay Tuned!
