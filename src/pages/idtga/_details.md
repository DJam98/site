changelog:
  - No rule changes this season, well excluding...
  - The map pool is everything
  - The focus in the season break has been working on the staff team (which we're still in progress)

We're in the endgame now.... as this will be the last season of IDTGA before we board a train and go to the splatlands in Splatoon 3! Because this will be the last season of IDTGA we'll be doing in Splatoon 2, we're not creating a maplist and the map pool will be everything. Every map with every mode combination to relish in Splatoon and rejoice it's greatness (and in some cases flaws).

Best of luck to you all, and we hope to see you in the bracket!
