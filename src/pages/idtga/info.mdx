Feel free to check out the full list of changes in the patch notes below!

**Patch Notes:**

- A minimum threshold for the Master Bracket has been created please see the most recent OTD blogpost for more information!
- Some changes to staff have been made internally so be patient with us as we get ourselves situated!
- Alongside the above staff changes we will be experimenting with a bi-monthly format until further notice.
- For full patch notes please refer to the most recent pull request on our GitHub.
