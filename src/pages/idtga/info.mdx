You know I'm starting to run out of things to put here. IDTGA 41. The scene's longest running FA tournament. What more is there to say?

**Patch Notes:**

- A bug has been fixed which broke the bot if guest users were created on the start.gg bracket.
- We're still working on fixing the 5 digit splashtag issue. If you are a player with five digits, please let us know with a screenshot in the helpdesk channel in the Off the Dial Discord server and place the first four digits on the signup page.
