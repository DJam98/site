Welcome to It's Dangerous to go Alone Season 45. This season, we're trialing the Nintendo Tournament Manager. Note that this is very much a beta test, so if this doesn't work as intended we will revert back to start.gg. We'd also like it if you could give us your personal feedback on your experience of using this as it will help us determine whether we use this or not.

**Patch Notes:**

- The brackets will be hosted on the Nintendo Tournament Manager, rather than start.gg.
- Swiss stage will no longer be a hard cap of four rounds, and will be determined by the Nintendo Tournament Manager
- Once teams are released, captains must register their team onto the Nintendo Tournament Manager bracket
- Swiss points distrubution has been altered to align with the Nintendo Tournament Manager
- Swiss tiebreakers have been altered to align with the Nintendo Tournament Manager
- Other areas of the rules and faq have been altered to align with the change to the Nintendo Tournament Manager
