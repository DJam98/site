Happy New Year! IDTGA returns for 2024. Reminder that this is your last chance to qualify for the IDTGA All Stars tournament, which will occur the week after this tournament. So if you have at least 800 signal strength, make sure you get as many points as possible! Nintendo is not a sponsor of or affiliated with this tournament.

**Patch Notes:**

- The site has been updated to include weapons from the most recent update
- Some bugs have been (hopefully) squashed to prevent the bot from crashing mid-tournament.
