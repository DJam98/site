The Creator Clash has concluded so it's time to come back to regular IDTGA! For this season, we've focused on increasing the scalability of the tournament, optimising the amount of matches played against similarly skilled players while also hopefully reducing rematches. During this season we'll also be taking a look into the Splattercolour Screen and the minimum rank, of which any changes may be implemented next season.

**Patch Notes:**

- Introducing the Master Bracket! The Master Bracket is the eXtreme bracket, even higher than the Power Bracket!
- Increased the registration cap from 192 players to 200 players.
- Also introducing pools into the preliminary stage of the tournament. If a bracket has 12 or more teams, pools will start to be formed. However, there will still only be 4 teams total that progress into the top cut of that bracket.
