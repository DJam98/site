We've learned our mistakes, we're not using the Nintendo Tournament Manager for a while! The changes for this season are primarily looking at reverting the FAQ and rules to revert the changes we made using the NTO. What we'll also be taking a look at this season is the potential of adding a minumum skill floor exclusivly for the Master bracket, as this is something we've been noticing from your feedback (thank you all for sending it in, it helps improve this tournament series even further!).

**Patch Notes:**

- Reverted most changes from IDTGA 45, moving back to start.gg
- Map & Weapon Preperations for the Sizzle Season launch.
- For full patch notes please refer to pull request #146 on our GitHub.
