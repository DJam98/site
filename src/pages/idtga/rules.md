- Player is a dropout of the previous season of the tournament.

## Format
Depending on the number of signups, multiple brackets are tiered based on the cumulative ELO (numerical score of all ranks) and competitive experience. There will be an even number of players in all brackets. The top-ranked players will be grouped in the higher brackets while the lower-ranked players will be placed in lower brackets.

- If there are `11` or less teams, there will be one bracket.
- If there are between `12` and `23` teams, there will be two brackets.
- If there are `24` or more teams, there will be three brackets.

All brackets will run independently of one another and will have their own preliminaries and top cut.

Brackets will be named accordingly if there are two or three brackets
- The top bracket will always be called the 'Power Bracket'
- The bottom bracket will always be called the 'Courage Bracket'
- The middle bracket, which will be only used if there are three brackets, will be called the 'Wisdom Bracket'.

## Brackets and Progression
### Preliminaries:
- Bracket: `Swiss`
- Matches: `Play-all-3`
- There are `4` total rounds
- Points will be allocated for games won, matches won, byes as well as ties. The point allocations are as such;
  - 3 point per game win
  - 6 points per match won (in addition to the points allocated for individual game wins)
  - 2 point per match tie (allocated to both teams, will be used if time has run out)
  - 8 points per bye (no points will be allocated as game wins as no games have been played)
- In the event a tiebreaker is needed, the following rules will be enacted sequentially until a winner has been determined
  - Total sets won
  - Head to head
  - Game win %
  - Team with less dropouts
  - Individal match point difference

### Top Cut:
- Bracket: `Single Elimination`
- Matches: `Best-of-5`
- The top `4` teams advance from the preliminaries. 
- There will be no 3rd place match played. 3rd place will be determined by preliminary results.

## Timing
The tournament is scheduled to last `4:00` hours total.
- Preliminaries take approximately `2:25` hours in total.
- Top cut take approximately `1:35` hours in total.

### Round Durations
- Each swiss round lasts `35` minutes.
- Each top cut round lasts `40` minutes.
- The very first swiss round lasts `5` more minutes, for `40` minutes total.
- Players must start their matches within `5` minutes of the round.
  - If the match has not started yet, the first game is automatically awarded to the team that's waiting.
  - For each additional `5` minutes that the match still hasn't started, an additional game will be awarded.
  - Please call a moderator in start.gg when this occurs so the game may be awarded to your team.
- There is a `5-minute` break before finals commence.

## DC's Redo Decision Rules
### Redo the match if:
- The objective does not have `50` or less objective remaining (excluding penalty) for either team.
- The match has not passed `2:30` before the DC has occured.
- Both teams use the same weapons/gear shown on the results screen.

### Do NOT redo the match if:
- **Any player** on the same team DC's again the same round.
- There has been a misuse of ending the game early (see below for more details)

To end the game, any player can push the `ZL`, `ZR`, `L`, `R` as well as pushing down the two sticks all at the same time for `3` seconds.

If either 2 DCs occur in the same lobby or the host DCs, the team currently not hosting must host the new lobby.

To reduce the chances of a dc happening, please check you have a good internet connection with low ping and/or have a LAN adapter for a smoother experience. If not, consider switching hosts.

### Lag

If there's are complaints about lag from at least 3 people on the same team or 1 person from each team, teams are required to switch hosts to someone on the opposing team. *Note that with Splatoon 3, it has been noted that some lag is normal, and may not be based on the host so please keep this in mind*.

## Misuse of Ending the Game Early
As of the current patch (1.1.2), anyone in the match can end the room. So because of this, some extra rules have been applied.
- If a misuse has occured, the team that has done the act will have that entire round set against them as 3-0.
- If a second missuse occurs again by the same player, that player forced to dropout (with regular dropout rules applying)
- If a second missuse ocurs again by someone in the same team, the entire team will be disqualified from the tournament.
- If a player abuses this system in a second tournament, they will be permantly banned from Off the Dial.
To report a misuse, use the Switch capture feature so we know who canceled the game, and make a report in the <Mention>#tourney-helpdesk</Mention>.  

## Reporting players
Sometimes, your team needs a replacement for one of your team members. Some examples may include:
- A team member notifies you that something has come up and they need to drop out.
- A team member just isn't responding at all to any messages.
- A team member is acting toxic to the rest of your team.
- A team member is making one or more of your other team members uncomfortable.

Thankfully, Off the Dial has an extensive system for reporting such players and receiving a sub, so you can be sure you'll have a good team experience.

- Your team can report players 24 hours after teams are released.
- Everyone on your team (besides the player getting reported) must approve of the report.
- Your sub is not allowed to play for any other player on your team except for the reported player they are replacing.
- Once your sub is assigned, the reported player is no longer allowed to play.
- **This is an irreversible action**, so be thoughtful when you report!

In all cases of player reporting, at least one of the team members must have at least tried to resolve the issue internally. If a player is non-responding, that means that it must be proven there has been an attempt to contact them several times with enough of a gap from the first message to account for timezone difference. In the cases of toxicity or making players feel uncomfortable, this attempt at resolution doesn't have to be done by the person who received the unwanted behaviour. However, there is an exemption if a team member is being disrespectful of race, gender, financial, religion or sexuality (however, other team members not including the two involved must also verify that this is the case).

### How to report
To report a player, send a message in the <Mention>#reporting</Mention> channel, formatted like this:
> <Mention>@ReportedPlayer</Mention> - Reason for reporting

If you don't feel comfortable reporting them publicly, you can send any staff member a DM instead :blue_heart:.

- Please ping the person that you are reporting, don't just give their username.
- For better chances of approval, make sure your reason is specific and detailed. Such as:
  > "Despite their status being set to online, they haven't responded to any of our DMs since teams have been created, multiple of our team members have attempted to get in contact with them, but to no avail".

Once you have made your report, our staff members will update you with the status of your report by reacting to your report message:
- :spiral_note_pad: - We've noted your report, and are working on matching a sub. This step usually takes 6-12 hours.
- :white_check_mark: - The report has been resolved, we have assigned a sub.
- :no_entry_sign: - We don't approve of the report. This usually doesn't happen, assuming you did everything correctly.

If there is no reaction, we haven't seen your report yet.

### Receiving your sub
Once you've been assigned your sub, you should see a reply to your original report, usually formatted like this:
> <Mention>@Sub</Mention> > <Mention>@ReportedPlayer</Mention>

You now know your sub. Friend them on discord, add them to your group chat, and hopefully get some practice in!

### When we have no available subs
Sometimes, there are no available subs to substitute for missing players. Often, this will be because none of the emergency subs has ranks that are similar to the player who has dropped out. In this case, the team is responsible for finding a new sub. This can be done by using the <Mention>#lf-pickup</Mention> channel in Off the Dial, or on another server. All substations must be approved by a TO and have signed up as a sub at [otd.ink/signup](https://otd.ink/signup).

### Matches with a missing player
If a dropout occurs during the tournament, you are still required to play. If you do not play your matches, regular round duration rules will still apply. So, in the event that a team is missing a player the __opposing team (the team without a dropout) will have the choice of whether to play in a 3v3 or a 3v4__. If the oppposing team wishes to do a 3v3, please let an organiser know and they will inform you of the best player to sub out to make the match as even as possible. If a 3v3 match is agreed upon, the team without the missing player will be awarded **the first game as their win** as compensation and enticement for a more fair match. The round will then continue as a 3v3 match from the second game within the round. *Note that if a 3v3 match is not agreed upon, and the match ends up being a 3v4, then this compentation does not apply*.

## Permitted Weapons and Gear
- All weapons and variations are allowed
- All gear purchased in game (with some exclusions)
- Any gear that is considered 'hacked gear' is not allowed. This is any gear that can't be obtained by normal means within the game. This includes having gear exclusive abilities, having brand favoured abilities as the main ability. No matter how the gear was obtained, it is not permitted. One warning will be given, if player continues they will be disqualified from the tournament.

## Cheating
Forms of cheating include, but are not limited to, playing under false names, bracket manipulation, providing false information in your profile or on start.gg, anything considered cheating by Nintendo, controller modifications, such as "turbo mode", and failure to comply with any of the rules on this document.

If you cheat:

- Instant disqualification from the tournament.
- A permanent ban from Off the Dial and all tournaments.

This is a strict no-chances policy, and we do not make exceptions to this.

## Others
- All rules are subject to change between seasons, please make sure you read the rules each season before entering.
- Head TOs reserve the right to alter the rules, delay the tournament, or cancel the event in it's entirety at any time due to unforseen circumstances on a case by case basis.
- If there are an uneven number of players, the latest signups will be set to removed from the tournament. Make sure to sign up early to reserve a team!
- If the hosting site for the bracket and matchmaking is failing to operate, the matchmaking will move to a manual process on our Discord server. If this occurs, please be patient as this take more time to setup.
- If the Nintendo Online or Splatoon 3's matchmaking is unavalible at the time of the event, the tournament will be delayed up to an hour until a fix is found. If the online service is still failing to operate after this time period, the tournament will be canceled.
- By registering you agree to abide by our [terms and conditions](/legal).
