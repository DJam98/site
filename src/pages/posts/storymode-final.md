## The Story
Ah, here's all the juicy details.

### The Countdown
You might of noticed the ~~[countdown](/countdown)~~ that has begun ticking down.

This is the countdown until when we start releasing lore for this chapter of the story mode. In previous chapters, we've had a lot of time, but not much lore that was released.

This time, we're containing the lore within two weeks. The chapter name will also be revealed at the end of the countdown.

### After the Countdown
In terms of those two weeks, here's how it'll work:

- When the timer hits zero, a video will be premiered or streamed live, which will announce the title of this chapter, and the introduction to the story of this chapter. There will be no hidden clues in this video.
- Later, 3 clues will slowly be revealed. Solving these clues will reveal story information, and one piece of the major clue hunt. Each of the three clues will have one of these pieces.
- Piecing together these three major clues will reveal one final piece of the story. The final hidden clue to the storyline.
- At the end of the tournament, the results that end this book of the story mode will be revealed.

**Good luck players,**  
**Stay tuned!**
