Time for the first tournament since our redesign, and off the bat we're playing Weakest Link! In this tournament, you register as either a **FA** or a **3-player team**. As a free agent, you'll be learning the ins and outs of how to play together with a higher level team. As a member of a 3-player team, you'll learn how to train up members of the Splatoon community to your advantage. 
> While everyone can play regardless of your skill levels, there are rank floors and caps for both categories.

For more details, you can check the [tournament page](/wl) on our website.

**This will be the last Off the Dial tournament until __December__.**
