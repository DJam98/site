After reviewing the last few seasons of It's Dangerous to go Alone, we're making some updates to the way we balance teams. Particularly, we're taking a look at the way we convert your ranks to what we call your 'ELO' number. In basic terms, your ELO is the number in which your solo q ranks and your competitive experience are used to create the foundation of team building whenever we make teams for every season of IDTGA.

Previously, we've run through two different balancing methods to convert all of your letter ranks into numerical values. Our first method was having to start at 100 points for C- and scale up by 100 points for every rank. After several months, we discovered flaws with this system - particularly with the lower ranks. Next, we moved to the default balancing system that was used by Splatoon itself within the game. While this did improve the balancing significantly, as we've been observing within recent months it also has its flaws - particularly when we have to deal with dropouts and emergency subs.

So over the next few months, we'll be testing out various different ways of balancing from what we've seen in It's Dangerous to go Alone as well as our own experiences within Splatoon matchmaking as both Rose and I (DJam98) have completed the grind and are both X rank players, so we have seen both sides of the coin.

It's going to be a bit of a learning curve as we test out these systems because the only way to test it is to actually have you guys play in the tourney! So feedback is going to be **essential** to getting this system right since you are the ones actually playing in the tournament.

We hope you'll continue to play and enjoy our tournaments and we hope to see you in the next season of It's Dangerous to go Alone!
