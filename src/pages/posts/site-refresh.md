I've been working on creating this website to replace the old markdown scripts. I spent a really long time making sure the website looks both clean and professional. I made sure to keep it relatively simple, and to make sure it isn't too drastic of a change.

And now, it's finally public! :tada:

This is just the first deploy, The main thing I focused on was styling the website to give it a unique feel, and then porting the pages. 
As of right now, it is still static. However, as time goes on, I will be adding more features and dynamic pages.

#### Here's some things that have changed:

- [x] The aesthetic and feel of the *entire* website.
- [x] A real navigation bar.
- [x] Updated posts page, where you can see the date and author, as well as a little excerpt.
- [x] Links to all the pages now look a lot nicer.
- [x] Easy access discord link in the corner.
- [x] Easy access to tournament pages in the corner.
- [x] Mobile users don't get nauseous looking at the page anymore.

#### Here's some things that are planned for the future:
- [ ] Tournament registration on the website
- [ ] Being able to log in with discord.
- [ ] User profiles.

If the first deploy's focus was porting the old site, the next deploy's focus will be on porting the bot features.

Stay tuned!
