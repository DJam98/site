It's really been four years! What a journey! We've had our ups and downs _and our fair share of dropouts_, but we've made it! The video below shows the complete broadcast of our Dial In stream, where we showcased everything that's happening for our anniversary, but below that I'll be going into a bit more detail onto some things.

## The Creator Clash

As you may of seen in the Dial In, 24 creators will be playing in a tournament we're calling **The Creator Clash** where all of these creators will battle it out in an [IDTGA](https://otd.ink/idtga) style tournament. In the Dial In, we revealed that [Mellana](https://www.twitch.tv/mellana), [Eppy](https://www.youtube.com/c/EppyIsMyName), [Nitrogue](https://twitter.com/NitrogueYT), [Chara](https://www.twitch.tv/prochara), [NineWholeGrains](https://twitter.com/NineWholeGrains), [Sheddy](https://www.youtube.com/c/LOrbSheddy), [The Barry](https://www.twitch.tv/thebarry), [Alice](https://twitter.com/Aloschus), [FlemiZ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDDtK7kp8dynchAd8F9xjtA), [Mr. Rookie](https://twitter.com/AyyElDee), [PixelSquid](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1EZL7J0QqWO-DFeLKN4WkA) and [Pufuu](https://twitter.com/PufuuLive) will all be joining us in The Creator Clash. But there's also another 12 players who we have yet to reveal! These last players will be revealed in this week's season of [It's Dangerous to go Alone](https://otd.ink/idtga).

If your favourite creator isn't playing, it could that they didn't want to participate, or that I just don't know them... unfortunately I don't know every single creator in the Splatoon scene and some just didn't want to play, which is completely understandable given that the game is four and a half years old.

## Prize Pool For IDTGA 4th Anniversary

Yes, there is a prize pool starting at $40 USD and increasing up to $120 USD depending on the amount of entrants. More details on the distribution of the pool and how the actual prize will be distributed will be announced at a later date.

You can donate to the prize pool by either going to [otd.ink/prizepool](https://otd.ink/prizepool) which will take you to a PayPal me page that says you are sending the money to myself (DJam98), this is so there's a central place to collect and distribute the money. I will be taking 0% of any funds donated to the prize pool (however PayPal may take a fee themselves, which is out of my control). Alternatively, you can donate to our Patreon at [otd.ink/patreon](https://otd.ink/patreon). For the months of January and February, all Patreon funds will go straight to the prize pool (excluding any fees of course).

## Dapple Productions x Off the Dial

Off the Dial and Dapple Productions will be collaborating for the second season of Snapshot, a major online tournament for Splatoon 2. More details on when the tournament will be released at a later date, however in the meantime you can join the [Snapshot Discord by clicking here](https://discord.gg/NQVGum8V43). What I can tease to you is that there will be a way for free agents to enter the tournament since we're collaborating in this event... _however don't tell anyone I said that_.

## Thank you all so much!
