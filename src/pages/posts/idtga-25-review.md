With our 25th season over, it's time to take a look at what happened in this season and to give you all some clarity on what happens behind the scenes here at Off the Dial. We're planning on continuing this for all upcoming seasons so if you have a question you'd like answered here let us know on the next feedback form!

### From the organisers

I'll be frank, IDTGA 25 didn't have the turnout that I was hoping for and because of this, we didn't get to see how the tiered brackets there won't be many changes and modifications to the rules, but if any are made, they'll all be posted in the blog post when we announce and finalise the date and time for It's Dangerous to go Alone 26. One of the main reasons for this is that we're going through the staff applications and will need time to ensure that any of the new staff know how things operate in Off the Dial.

### Now what did you all say in the feedback!

*Make a better maplist.*
> Well I'm not going to lie, but I agree it wasn't a great maplist. And we'll look into making a better  maplist for the next season. However, because our tournaments are quite regular, there will always be some maps on the list that won't be on your favourites.

*Oh, the plug-in for the website to register on smash.gg is kinda buggy.*
> I know exactly what you mean. The smash.gg embed for registration that is on the signup page isn't the greatest. Plus, recently they removed the option to select skip for now when signing up for the tournament. Because of this we're working with some people to remove this option and just have it so you can enter in your smash.gg profile URL and you don't actually need to register yourselves. However, due to how the signup page was initially configured it's not as simple as it sounds (I tried deleting it earlier this year and it completely broke the signup page). So while it's one of our highest priorities regarding fixing any code, it still may take a while. So please forgive us and we hope you'll give us some patience to fix these issues.

*Possibly use weapons to help build teams? I didn't have many issues with it but I worry for teams who might.*
> When we originally discussed introducing play styles into the IDTGA this was discussed. However there are some issues that arise with players putting in their weapons instead of play styles. First of all, there isn't one way to play a weapon. For example, the nautilus can be played very offensively or in a more supportive manner. The same can be said about a lot of the shooter class as well. Secondly, when we make the teams, the play styles are converted into numbers so we can make sure that all teams have a similar amount of each type of play style. And yes, this method isn't perfect either - but when you have 60+ registrations, any time save is a godsend when creating teams (trust me, it's not a quick thing to do).

*Weakest Link when?*
> Ahh Weakest Link, it's been a while since we've had one of these tourneys. Unfortunately, we don't have any plans for a Weakest Link tournament. The main reasons for this is that the current code doesn't support anything other than registration for IDTGA, and therefore has dropped down the list of priorities for what needs to be done in the code. It will come back eventually, but it will likely be part of the Special Series when it returns.

And that's all! There weren't that many feedback responses this time round but I hope to see some questions in the form after IDTGA 26. Regarding IDTGA 26, we plan to announce more details about it in the upcoming week!

So stay tuned everyone, we'll see you all in Inkopolis Square soon!
