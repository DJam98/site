We've arrived at the Splatlands, and our paperwork is finally in order - so free agents, it's time to get splating in this new land of chaos!

So I'll go right into the nitty gritty. We're not changing the classic IDTGA formula too much this season as we'll need to do some trials by fire to get things tested. So please bear with us as we all experience and understand this game.

Changes
Added ELO allocations for S+10 to S+50 (allocations for C- to S+9 will remain the same for now)
The Swiss scoring system has been updated to 3 points for a game win, 6 points for a match win, 8 points for a bye, and 2 points per game tie.

Wait, what's in this package?

... *unwrapping* ...

... *still unwrapping* ...

... *they really put a lot of bubble wrap in here* ...

It's some new Sendou badges! Each bracket will now receive its own badges when they win. Isn't that cool?

**Feedback from previous tournaments**
I've been a little busy, so I haven't had the time to post about the feedback from the previous tournaments, so let's dump it all here, shall we?

The tiered bracket system has been positively received, which is excellent news! There hasn't ever been a free agent tournament with an open skill barrier that has had multiple brackets, so I'm glad that people are enjoying this new system. I hope to continue using them (we need enough people to register!).

People in the feedback were not too happy about the maplist from our final season for Splatoon 2. And to that, I say... just read. I put in all of our promotional material that IDTGA 33 would have every map/mode in the map pool... so I don't know what you were expecting...

Now let's dive into some of those questions!

*Will we be able to earn rewards using the signal strength we've accumulated over the months?*
Eventually, yes, I would like to do something that gives a reward for the signal strength, but right now, we don't have the facilities to do so. If we were to do that, we would need to build a whole kind of virtual shop - which not only has to be developed, but we need to be earning enough money (of which we're not making any) and the whole legal shenanigans of a shop.

*How did you sort the teams into their brackets?*
Teams are created based on combining solo ranks with competitive experience and then balancing the teams based on their play style. We take into consideration time zones a little bit as well.

*Who are the first and/or original hosts of IDTGA? Who creates the maplists and who sets up brackets?*
The original host of IDTGA? That would be me - DJam98! I've been doing this for almost five years now. It's such a pleasure to have staff now who help me take care of all the other tasks that come with running a tournament of this scale, and different people handle different tasks each season - nor would I expose them if someone thought that a maplist was terrible.

*No questions! You all work hard, and ill be sure to play next season if I can. :>*
Awesome, that's great to hear! See you then.

*Why are players on teams allowed to join? I had a teammate who had to drop because they were playing another tournament today, IDTGA being advertised as a fa tourney as opposed to a more general draft tourney gives the impression that the players will all not be on teams. Also, consider hosting this on Sunday in the future to avoid clashes with Minnow Cup, LSL, etc.*
If you're on the same team as someone competitively, we try to avoid matchups to provide an even playing field. However, sometimes something slips through the cracks as we do not have the roster of every team memorised - especially when it comes to the frantic nature that occurs when handling dropouts in the middle of the tournament.

Regarding your second question, we have moved the tournament once to avoid some tournaments, but it is impossible not to have a clash on a weekend. So choose your battles (literally).

*Definitely be playing any other tournament you guys have, it was amazing to be apart of this one*
I'm glad you enjoyed the tournament and can't wait to see you in the next season you play!

*Will Turf War be added to OTD tournaments?*
Short answer, no. But we'll judge where the competitive scene goes and what the majority would like to see and base it off that in the future once we understand Splatoon 3 a bit more.
