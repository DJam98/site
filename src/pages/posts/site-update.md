Welcome back everyone, I hope you're all of your new year celebrations went as smoothly as it can in this chaotic world *(maybe we're already living in Splatsville, the city of chaos?)*.

Regardless of that, our website has received it's newest update - and the biggest one in a while! Huge thanks to <Mention>@LeptoFlare</Mention> for coming back from the abyss to help us out with that one! The biggest change that this updated website brings is a refresh on the signup page and the removal of the smash.gg embed! You no longer have to register with smash.gg when registering for one of our tournaments - however you will still need to place in your smash.gg user slug so that we can add you to the smash.gg page once registration closes!

We hope you like this update as much as we do! If you're unsure on how to register on this new site, take a look at the YouTube video below!
