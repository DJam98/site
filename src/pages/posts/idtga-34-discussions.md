The cogs are finally turning again as we've just *(with a little delay)* finished up our 34th season of It's Dangerous to go Alone - which was also our first tournament in Splatoon 3! We also had three brackets for our first time, so let's dive into the feedback!

# Behind the Scenes Review

During the tournament, I was astounded by how smoothly the event ran. I was expecting a lot more dropouts and helpdesk issues, and while there were a few, there was nowhere near what I was expecting - so thank you all for making this a smooth tournament for us behind the scenes! After spending over four hours staring at a spreadsheet to balance you all, it was an enjoyable experience, and on behalf of the entire staff team, I thank you.

The three most significant things we noticed were that the rank conversion needs a bit more balancing, some modifications needed to be made when a match ends early on account of an accident or miscommunication, as well as special rules when the host DCs (given the instability Splatoon) 

# Questions / Comments From You

*This didn't hamper our enjoyment of the game at all, but our team was essentially four slayers/support with no anchor, and we were pretty desperately in need of an anchor.*
> Sometimes, there aren't enough players who register as a backline, and this was probably the case in this scenario, but we'll still try and look into this for the next season.

*Don't really have anything to add excited for next tournament!*
> Awesome, I can't wait to see you play!

*Would it be possible to make subs more available?*
> No. It's up to people individually to register as a sub, and we can't control that.

*No questions only <3*
> <3

*I'll win next time >:)*
> Oh, will you now?

*why is this a required question?*
> My bad, I didn't realise (fixed now).

*I have one question, but I'm pretty sure there is an answer somewhere. But what is Signal Strength?*
> Signal strength is our internal measuring of how much you have played in our tournaments. Consider it like an XP bar for Off the Dial.

*Kinda fitting that the first Splatoon 3 tournament had 3 brackets, huh? On a more serious note, how do you feel the transition to Splatoon 3 has gone, especially with such a massive turnout for your first event?*
> It was huh! As I mentioned earlier, I feel like it has gone smoothly. We've had a few hiccups, but after getting those resolved, we're ready to start planning for our next major events *(stay tuned)*!
