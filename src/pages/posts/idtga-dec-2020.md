It's about time we revealed this month's IDTGA.

With a lot of new players coming to test out Splatoon thanks to the #FreeMelee movement, many players may not have a team yet. If you are one of those people, I hope this tournament can help you experience what it's like to play in a tournament, even if you don't have a team yet.

Likewise, if you know anyone from Smash who may be interesting in testing the waters of competitive splatoon, Invite them to signup!
