Off the Dial will be going on a brief hiatus until December. :beach_with_umbrella:  
This means there will not be any Off the Dial tournaments until December.

Why you may ask? Well there's a number of factors....

#### DJam98 has exams
Djam is currently in his final year of exams, thus, he doesn't enough time to both study for his exams, and run tournaments.  
Everyone wish him luck on his exams!

#### Website updates
This hiatus will give me enough time to implement some key features. These features include logging in with discord, registration on the website, and user profiles on the website.

If you can't wait and want an early peek, I'll be streaming development on my [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/leptoflare). Come by if you want to help me test features before they go completely live.

#### Growing the organisation
I will also be using this hiatus to grow and expand Off the Dial, reach more people, and to make our first tournament back a spectacular one.

Firstly, there is the number of people that sign up. I have a couple things planned to help boost player turnout, so keep your eyes peeled for new information regarding that.

Another thing is a proper staff team. I'm planning on working on a system for managing staff and roles, not just head organisers. If that is something you're interested in, be on the lookout for when we start our very first staff applications.

Stay tuned!
