Another month, another season. Let's get those cogs turning once again! As said in our [previous blog post](https://otd.ink/posts/idtga-25-review) there aren't going to be many patch notes and changes this season as we didn't get to test out the tiered brackets. We're also in the process of reviewing the staff applications, but for all of those deets, read on below!

As always to register, head over to our signup page at [https://otd.ink/signup](https://otd.ink/signup)

### Sendou.ink Badges

### Staff Applications
Thank you to all of you who applied to becoming a staff member for Off the Dial. We'll be contacting you in the upcoming days and will be going into direct conversations shortly (keep an eye on your DMs)!

### Patch Notes
- Round duration for preliminaries have been extended by 5 minutes. The first round now goes for 40 minutes and the following rounds will be 35 minutes.
- The reporting grace period has been removed. 
  - Previously, there was a grace period after the 30 minutes to allow teams to report scores without the system automatically determining the result as a draw. This has now been removed as matches have been extended by 5 minutes. Matches will automatically be determined as a draw when the match timer reaches either 35 minutes (or 40 in the first round).

Make sure to read the [rules](https://otd.ink/idtga/rules) and [terms and conditions](https://otd.ink/legal) before registering for the tournament.
