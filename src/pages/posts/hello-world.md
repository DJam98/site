Wow, we finally did it, we have a brand new website that we can use! Should I get the party poppers?
Putting celebrations aside, this new website can be browsed to your heart's content.

It provides a centralized place to find everything Off the Dial.
As of right now, the website is simply hosting static documents regarding Off the Dial and the tournaments.

Below, we've listed a few questions that you might have.

#### Where can I find the website?
To get to our main homepage, click the **Off the Dial** text above or enter [`otd.ink`](https://otd.ink) into your browser.

#### What has changed for me?
There are a few things that have changed, let's go through them:

- ##### Rules:
  Originally we had the rules on a Google Doc, although this gave us a lot of customization regarding format compared to Discord, accessibility was limited. Now, you can find the rules for each tournament by going to `otd.ink/<tournament>/rules`.
  
  One of the main advantages to using a website to host our rules is accessibility. A website url is much easier to display, type and remember than a google doc url.
  Additionally, Off the Dial bot is able to scrape the webpage to embed sections of the rules directly through a bot command, more on that later.

- ##### Other Pages:
  Channels like the [`#community`](https://otd.ink/community) and [`#faq`](https://otd.ink/faq) are migrated to the website as well.
  There is additionally a new page for the [`bot`](https://otd.ink/bot) that serves as a simple place to find information on Off the Dial Bot.

  This provides a good balance between the freedom to edit parts of the page at any time on a google doc, and the accessibility of a discord channel.

#### It looks really boring at the moment, is this going to change?
Yes! We're currently working towards improving the look to give the website a unique style and feel, as well as building dynamic and intuitive pages.

However, that takes a lot longer to write and encode than simple markdown, so it's going to take some time. Eventually we'll have it ready.

#### Can I register on here on the website?
Not yet. However, we plan on having registration entirely done on the website in the future. 

#### Who's building this website?
The base of the website was originally built by LeptoFlare, and is being currently maintained by both DJam98 and LeptoFlare. As the website continues to progress and mature, LeptoFlare and DJam98 will be working on it together.

#### Bot commands?
There are a couple new bot commands that integrate with the website. You can find them by doing `$website`.

#### Where can I contribute?
The source code for this website can be found [here](https://github.com/offthedial/site).

### Final thoughts

We're going to continue working on improving your experience with Off the Dial. Whether that be through the website, smash.gg, Discord and of course the actual tournament experience! We're here to make this experience be the best it can be.

Stay Tuned!
