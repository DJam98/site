March? What's that? Oh riiiiiight, it was supposed to be the next season of IDTGA. Well things happened and March doesn't exist any more, mwahahahahaha!

Don't worry, we'll still be having two tournaments in April!

1. Have a chance to meet new people.
1. Get your name out there.
1. Get competitive experience, even if you don't have a team.
