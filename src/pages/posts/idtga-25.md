We've reached our 25th tournament! Woohoo! [insert celebration of immenseness happiness here]. This season we've got a bunch of NEW changes coming to the series that should hopefully make It's Dangerous to go Alone even better!

### Tiered Brackets
This is something we've been planning and you've been asking for a long time, and thanks to the incredible amount of signups from the last two seasons, we're ready to release it! We're bringing to you **tiered brackets**. This replaces the previous pool system.

This works quite similarly to some other tiered bracket systems seen in other tournaments where there are alpha and beta brackets. Each bracket is tiered based on your ELO (numerical ranks of all ranked modes) and competitive experience, and will run independently of each other. There will be an even number of players in both brackets, however, there needs to be at least 16 teams (64 players) for this to run (otherwise each of the brackets will be too small).

For example if there were 72 registrations, the top 36 players would be put in the higher bracket and the bottom 36 players will be put in the lower bracket. For every 16 teams, there will be another bracket.

### This Season Only: PRIZES
All players in the top team of **each** bracket will receive a prize of one month Classic Nitro *(you think we're made of money? This is just as a celebration)*

### Sendou.ink Badges
The winning team of the top bracket will now receive [sendou.ink](https://sendou.ink) badges!

### Staff Changes
There have been a few staff changes recently, but the major ones are that <mention>@LeptoFlare<mention> has unfortunately left us (due to personal reasons). Lepto played a major role in developing both the Off the Dial Bot and this website you're on now and while we're sad to see them go, we wish you all the best in your future endeavours! However, this does leave us without a proper developer to work on both the website and bot, so you may not some highly requested (or previously announced) changes until we find a new developer.

On a more positive note, <mention>@rose!<mention> will be stepping up as a Head TO! We hope to see that the future of Off the Dial goes as positively as you are yourself!

### Other Patch Notes
- Updated the [FAQ](https://otd.ink/faq) to add some new questions and remove some pointless ones.
- Added an eligibility section to the [rules](https://otd.ink/idtga/rules).
- Updated pools to reflect the tiered brackets.
- Updated other progression phases to reflect tiered brackets (4 teams still move to top cut).
- Pools renamed to Prelimiaries.
- Added new text under timing about distributing games from an absent team.
- Added new section in reporting, which adds a new rule that teams must try to resolve all incidents internally before reporting (unless an exemption applies - see [rules](https://otd.ink/idtga/rules).
- Added new section in subs to clarify what happens when there are no eligible subs that have signed up.
- The [bot page](https://otd.ink/bot) has been updated to reflect active commands.
- The [feedback page](https://otd.ink/feedback) has been changed to be a redirection to the google form that has feedback form.
- The [staff page](https://otd.ink/staff) is being changed as there have been some staff changes. Note that this is not yet complete.
- Naming of seasons has reverted back to numbers (in this case IDTGA 25) instead of month/year.
