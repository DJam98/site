It's December already? Well let's cut to the chase shall we; we've got a lot of important news to show.

#### Off the Dial Staffing

I'm very excited to announce that I've put a system in place to manage staff for Off the Dial. This means Off the Dial will be able to scale and accept more staff members as we grow. With this, the community page has been changed to a staff page and has been moved to [otd.ink/staff](/staff).

With this being said, **staff applications are now open** for the upcoming IDTGA (more on that later).

There are a lot of different staff roles that you can apply for, such as on-day staffing, commentating, and technical work. Please, read through all of them.

Since this is the very first opening of staff applications, we are going to be very selective and intentional with who we bring onto the staff team. Do not expect a lot of staff members to be accepted. However, this shouldn't discourage you from applying.

###### If you're interested, please visit [otd.ink/staff/apply](/staff/apply).

#### Website Updates

I've tweaked some minor things about the website and changed some internal stuff. Here's an overview.

1. **Updated post layout** - You may have already noticed the different layout for posts. I did this because I read some random web-dev article about how this looks better... I also changed the look of the posts page.
2. **Migrated community page** - As mentioned above, the community page has migrated to [otd.ink/staff](/staff). I also changed the look of the staff page.
3. **Tweaked Footer** - The media footer now has a light-grey background as opposed to a horizontal line. No this was not in another random web-dev article.

Many features are still in development!

- You'll soon be able to log in with your discord account.
- I'm working overtime to make signup on-site a reality before the upcoming IDTGA. Speaking of which...

#### Upcoming IDTGA

The date for the next IDTGA is yet to be announced. Since this is our first one back from the hiatus, there's a lot planned.

You can look forward to...

1. Signing up for IDTGA on the Off the Dial website.
2. Hopefully higher turnout with the help of [IPL](https://iplabs.ink) and [Checkpoint 1](https://discord.gg/c7CpftUuYK).

#### What's next?

There's still so much that I have planned for the future of Off the Dial! Here's just a couple:

- Have the Off the Dial Bot automate more during the tournament, such as automated messages for each round.
- A bonus tournament, to beta-test the bot before it's used in one of our main tournaments.
- Prizes!?
- Ways for you to help fund the future of Off the Dial, through Patreon.

#### Closing thoughts

Thank you so much for supporting Off the Dial in all of its endeavors up to this point, I can't wait to show you everything else we have planned.
Stay tuned!
