*Teams have just been released. Feeling anxious, you slowly move you mouse over the <Mention>#teams</Mention> channel... and click.*

So you just received the Weakest Link/Team you are paired with. As you shift focus to the week ahead, how do you prepare before tournament day?

I made this post to hopefully give some tips on what I'd recommend.

Keep in mind I'm not a qualified coach, these tips are from my own experience and, well, I don't have a lot of that. As such, please take these tips with a grain of salt.

### Teams:
#### Focusing on being the best at coaching, not the best at playing.
Remember, you don't need to be the most skilled team to win this tournament!

We balance teams such that coaching your Weakest Link will have the highest impact on your team's performance.

So try to focus as much of your attention on coaching your weakest link as possible. 

####  Be encouraging
Your Weakest Link is likely not to be as skilled as your team, so remember to keep that in mind when giving advice.

Be patient and understanding! Insults and toxicity won't help them improve.

#### Don't micro-manage
It can be tempting to tell your Weakest Link what to do every step of the way. However, this will lead to the Weakest Link feeling restrained, hesitant to think on their own. This sabotages their confidence and flexibility.

Furthermore, they don't understand the reason behind the orders, which doesn't help them learn.

#### The official guide to coaching.
Dr. Prodigy and FLC created a wonderful, comprehensive [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pmdHhGNj6SXZA9W3BUAgntI3urgiJDql35p-d7Qsdaw) on coaching.

This guide isn't a prerequisite to signing up, and I don't expect teams to read the entire thing. 

However, I strongly recommend at-least skimming over it if you have the time.

### The Weakest Link
#### Keep an open mind
Make sure to stay open to what your teammates have to say about your gameplay.

It can greatly quicken the process of learning and improving.

#### Ask Questions
There may be scenarios where you find you commonly struggle in.

Your team might not pick up on that, so don't be afraid to ask questions and be proactive in your improvement.

#### The Appeal to Authority Fallacy
It's true that you may not be as skilled as the 3-player-team. But don't let this stop you from having your own ideas, thoughts, and takes on what you should do.

Feel free to experiment on your own, and tell your team your own ideas.
