So you just received the Team/Weakest Link that you're paired with. As you shift your focus to the week ahead, how do you properly prepare for tournament day?

I made this post to hopefully give some tips on what I'd recommend.

Keep in mind I'm not a qualified coach, these tips are from my own experience and, well, I don't have a lot of that. As such, please take these tips with a grain of salt.

### Teams:
#### Focusing on being the most effective coach, not the most skilled team.
Remember, you don't need to be the most skilled team to win this tournament!

We balance teams in a way where coaching your Weakest Link will have the highest impact on your team's performance, So try to focus as much of your attention on coaching your weakest link as possible.

#### Be encouraging
Your Weakest Link is likely not to be as skilled as your team, that's kind of the point. Keep that in mind when giving advice.

Be patient and understanding, point out the positives, encourage improvement! Insults and toxicity won't help them improve.

#### Don't micro-manage
It can be tempting to tell your Weakest Link exactly what to do, every step of the way. However, this will lead to them feeling restrained, unable to think on their own, which hinders their confidence and flexibility as a player (kind of important things!). Furthermore, they won't understand the reasoning, which doesn't help them learn.

So try giving them the freedom to make their own decisions, and respond afterwards with critique. Rather than state exactly how you would like them to act.

#### The official guide to coaching.
Dr. Prodigy and FLC created a wonderful, comprehensive [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pmdHhGNj6SXZA9W3BUAgntI3urgiJDql35p-d7Qsdaw) on coaching.

This guide isn't a prerequisite to signing up, and I don't expect teams to read the entire thing. 

However, I strongly recommend at-least skimming over it if you have the time.

### The Weakest Link
#### Keep an open mind
Make sure to stay open to what your teammates have to say about your gameplay.

It can greatly quicken the process of learning and improving.

#### Ask Questions
There may be scenarios where you find you commonly struggle in.

Your team might not pick up on that, so don't be afraid to ask questions and be proactive in your improvement.

#### The Appeal to Authority Fallacy
It's true that you may not be as skilled as the 3-player-team. But don't let this stop you from having your own ideas, thoughts, and takes on what you should do.

Don't be afraid to experiment on your own, and tell your team your own ideas.
