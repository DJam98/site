Now that we've had a season of X rank, I can very safely say that it works **VERY** differently than it did in Splatoon 2, at least in terms of how ELO calculations work in It's Dangerous to go Alone. Also, I'll be discussing on some of the feedback that you all left us in the feedback form from IDTGA 36.

## A New Bracket Split

In Splatoon 2, it was very easy to split between X rank and regular S+, as you had to reach S+10, then you were stuck with your X rank. This was very benificial to us as it allowed for an easy system to convert and adapt with this system. But in Splatoon 3, the fact that you can improve both at the same time (not to mention you can't drop your anarchy rank from losing matches) doesn't allow for an easy conversion to allow for even balancing. So because of this, X ranks will be calculated into ELO within their own bracket.

I will also note, that X rank is a much more accurate depiction of your rank, so if you have an X rank, please put that in, not your anarchy rank.

Also because of this new change, brackets will be split at different sizes, so instead of reaching a certain threshold to have mutliple bracket, the requirement for the bracket to split is that each bracket needs to have `6` teams (24 players).

## Last Season of IDTGA????

Wait... huuh.... what's this.....

This will be the last **regular** season of IDTGA for a while, so if you want your classic IDTGA, make sure to get in! Don't worry though, free agent tournaments will be continuing during our 5th anniversary celebrations, it'll just be a bit different.

Stay tuned for more information being released in mid January during our 5th Anniversary 'Dial In' presentation.

## Questions / Comments From You

*great tournament can't wait for the next one*
> Awesome, it won't be long until the next one!

*Overall, IDTGA is fun! There are just some communication issues.*
> Apologies on that, we'll be more clear in our announcements during the tournament in the future.

*Having all the new players to the Splatoon competitive scene push lil ol' me up into the Wisdom bracket is certainly encouraging for the growth of this tournament series, this server, and this game as a whole. Keep up the good work! Let's try and hit that 192-player cap in IDTGA 37!*
> That would be awesome, we'll just have to see!

*Mahi mahi deserves to be victim of the next Big run*
> Hahahaha, wouldn't we all. For context, because Wahoo World was the subject of big run, that map wasn't in the maplist for this season of IDTGA.

*Despite the initial hiccups with re-shuffling teams, the whole thang went really smoothly as far as OTD is concerned, and even those hiccups were handled fairly quickly.*
> Dropouts are by far the biggest issue we hate and we try and do everything we can to reduce them, but unfortunately due to the nature of our tournament it is something that will always be present.

*Hi :)*
> Heyo!
