### Special Updates
As February is our anniversary, we've made some big changes! :tada:

#### :package: Off the Dial Site v1.0
For IDTGA December (Site Alpha) and IDTGA January (Site Beta), I've been slowly refining the process of signing up on the site.

Now it's official, all features are fully implemented, and the site is much more stable to use (hopefully).

#### :loudspeaker: Brand new reporting rules in place!
The official IDTGA rules has been *entirely reworked* for reporting players (previously just dropouts)!

We saw a beta of this last season with the <Mention>#reporting-dropouts</Mention> channel, but now it's fully thought-out. [Take a look](https://otd.ink/idtga/rules#reporting-players)!

#### :trophy: Prize?
For this coming IDTGA, we have the *utmost luxurious, expensive, and generous prize* of 1 month nitro classic ;) depending on how many people attend. Because of this, we've added another section to our [legal document](https://otd.ink/legal).

Seriously, we're broke...

#### :signal_strength: Signal Strength Reset
Yes! Now that the site has been fully implemented, we can accurately distribute and calculate signal strength. Thus, all previous signal strength has all been reset to `0`.

You may have noticed that we didn't give out any signal strength for season alpha or beta. Since the site was in a relatively unstable place, it was hard to distribute fairly given the subs and dropouts.

However, I still wanted to give players who competed in seasons alpha and beta something, for stress testing the site, check out your profile for that.

I probably missed a couple people, if you missed out, just dm me and i'll fix it.

You will also now be able to get the <Mention>Signal Strength: 1000+</Mention> and <Mention>@Signal Strength: 5000+</Mention> roles if you try hard enough.
