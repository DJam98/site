It's the first IDTGA of the year! Let's get into the details...

> With a lot of new players coming to test out Splatoon thanks to the [#FreeMelee](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreeMelee) movement, many players may not have a team yet.
>
> If you are one of those people, I hope this tournament can help you experience what it's like to play in a tournament, even if you don't have a team yet.
>
> Likewise, if you know anyone from Smash who may be interesting in testing the waters of competitive splatoon, Invite them to signup!
