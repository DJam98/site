Hey there! I'm DJam98 and I am the creator of this little Discord
server on the internet.

I spend most of my spare time on Off the Dial and playing games on
the Switch (and spending way too much time in Splatoon).

I have a Twitch and Twitter, if you want to check that out, I would greatly appricate that! I stream a lot of Splatoon, but also a bunch of other games. Or as I like to say at the start of every stream "I'm a TO, streamer, commentator, and whatever I feel like doing!".

Hi! I'm one of the current head TOs for Off the Dial.

I try to help where I can, whether it be streaming, commentating, or day-of business. I run the Special Series on Off the Dial, where I run an off-the-walls idea and turn that into a little bit of fun for everyone.

I am a former Nautilus 79 main and I played for RIOT before its disbandment after LUTI 11. I stream and play VALORANT whenever I'm home, but usually I'm writing papers and studying for exams for college.

If you're interested, please check out my Twitter and Twitch! Follows are greatly appreciated and I hope to see you in a tourney!

Hi I'm Wolf! I'm one of the Staff in Off the Dial.

I'm a Splatoon enjoyer who plays way too much of it but I also enjoy playing other games both on the Switch and PC.
