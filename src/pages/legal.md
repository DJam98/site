# Terms and Conditions
By registering into any event organised by 'Off the Dial' you have read and agreed to the following conditions below.

We all know you aren't going to *actually* read these... unless you are, like, a lawyer or something. At least it's not as long as other documents.

1. All events Off the Dial organises are 'Signatory events' as defined by the [Splatoon Safety - Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pf6S25d2rFDAP5JUJzaVeEkb0OGYIaGo-LQ3KGXUOpA). Players that have current bans as defined by the 'Splatoon Safety Council' are not permitted to be a competitor, commentator, moderator, organiser, or streamer in any event that Off the Dial may organise as long as their ban remains valid.
1. Off the Dial is not in the business of selling your data. Any data collected by Off the Dial or the event organisers of Off the Dial can and may be used in future events until updated by the participant. This information will not be shared with anyone else (excluding event organisers) without the participant's permission. This excludes information that is used or seen publically during the event's duration (IGN, friend code, ranks).
1. Matches of the event may be streamed on the official Off the Dial livestream or by participants who may be also participating in the event. By registering in the event, participants are giving their permission for their in-game avatars to be showcased on social media platforms (such as YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, etc), and for the use of promotional material made by Off the Dial or by participants in the event.
1. For any teams that Off the Dial create, participants agree that the teams are assigned purely on skill and harbour no favouritism towards any participant.
1. Off the Dial follows the terms of service for all platforms, products, and services used. As such, you are to follow all of the terms of service of any other platforms, products, and services that Off the Dial uses.
1. Changes to the event may occur due to unforeseen circumstances. If changes do occur, participants either accept these changed or remove themselves from the current season before check-in closes.
