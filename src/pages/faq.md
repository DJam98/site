## General

#### What is my 'Signal Strength'?

Consider it like an XP bar for your involvement with Off the Dial. You earn 100 points for each tournament you participate in, and can earn up to 100 more depending on your placement.

There's also roles for <Mention>@Signal Strength: 1000+</Mention> and <Mention>@Signal Strength: 5000+</Mention> if you want a meaningless amount of pointless clout, good luck!

#### Will tournaments be streamed?

Yes, one match from each round in the highest skill bracket will be streamed. There will be a five-minute break before top cut.

#### How are disputes/issues resolved?

When in doubt, use <Mention>#helpdesk</Mention>. Optionally, you can use <Mention>#tourney-helpdesk</Mention> for tournament-related questions.

During the tournament, if there is a match dispute or any conflict, please use the "Call a Moderator" feature on start.gg.

You may also DM either Head Organiser about it.

#### How are teams balanced?

Teams are balanced based on your ranks, weapon pool and previous competitive experience.

#### Am I able to scrim other teams competing in the tournament?

We're completely fine with you setting up scrims with other competing teams. Just remember to be respectful!

#### Why organization spelled with an 's'?

This is an international server, some of us are part of Australia and EU, which spell certain words slightly differently, namely 'organisation'.

#### I need help using start.gg, where can I get it?

If no staff is able to answer your question in <Mention>#helpdesk</Mention>, you can contact [start.gg](https://help.start.gg/) directly on their website or using their discord.

#### What is Weakest Link, and will it be returning?

Weakest Link is a tournament where three experienced players team up with one inexperienced solo player. These teams are assigned by Off the Dial and have one week to practice. We don't plan on having another Weakest Link in the near future, but we'll see.

#### I've heard some rumours about an Off the Dial Story Mode. What is this?

The Off the Dial Story Mode was a story driven, ARG tournament with the results impacting the next chapter of the story. It requires several months of planning and preparation, and we don't see ourselves doing this again in the near future.

## It’s Dangerous to go Alone

#### What is It's Dangerous to go Alone (IDTGA)?

It's Dangerous to go Alone (or IDTGA for short), is our flagship, solo registration tournament! Focused on creating balanced teams, and being accessible to everyone.

Players sign up **individually**, you aren't allowed to sign up as an entire team. Players are all assigned a team based on the information provided in the registration form. Then, teams are given 48 hours to practice before the tournament!

#### Who is allowed to play? (Is there a skill limit/cap?) (What if I'm already on a team?)

The goal of IDTGA is allow anyone to be able to experience a tournament regardless of whether they have a team or not, there is no skill ceiling or skill cap, anyone is allowed to enter.

Even if you do have a team, you and your teammates can still play! Just don't expect to end up on the same team.

#### Why are there multiple brackets?

In order to ensure that the skill gap between players on a given team aren't too far apart, we divide players into multiple brackets based on skill level, so that your teammates are generally close enough to your skill range.

For example, if there were two brackets, the top ranking 50% of players will be placed in the higher bracket, and the lower 50% in the lower bracket. This is quite similar to 'alpha' and 'beta' brackets you see in other large tournaments, but we divide individual players instead of teams.

The skill brackets are, in order of highest skill to lowest skill: **Power** (highest), **Wisdom** (middle), and **Courage** (lowest). Note that depending on the number of signups, not all brackets will be used. A new bracket is added for every 12 teams.

#### I just lost my set, am I out of the tournament?

No, this tournament's format is Swiss, not Single or Double Elimination. So make sure you have played **all of the rounds** in the preliminaries!

#### I’ve just finished a season of IDTGA, what do I do now?

Congrats! We hope you had fun! If you didn't make top cut, you can still watch the rest of the tournament on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/offthedial)!

If you have any feedback on how we can improve the tournament in the future, please let us know at [otd.ink/feedback](https://otd.ink/feedback).
