<Title title="FAQ">
  We get asked a lot of questions, so a FAQ necessary. You can find anything from "What is Signal Strength?" to "What is Swiss?".
</Title>

## General
#### What is my 'Signal Strength'?
Consider it a numerical representation of your experience within Off the Dial. You earn 100 points for each tournament you participate in, and can earn up to 100 more depending on your placement. There are also <Mention>@Signal Strength: 1000+</Mention> and <Mention>@Signal Strength: 5000+</Mention> if you want an inconsequential amount of pointless clout, good luck!

#### What time do tournaments begin?
All tournaments begin on the same minute/hour, but due to timezones that time may differ. Daylight savings times have been listed as well.

Refer to your corresponding time-zone.

- `EST` 3pm Saturday
- `EDT` 4pm Saturday
- `GMT` 8pm Saturday
- `BST` 9pm Saturday
- `JST` 5am Sunday
- `AEST` 6am Sunday
- `AEDT` 7am Sunday

#### What time do tournaments end?
Tournaments are scheduled to last 3:30-4:00 hours.
Each pools round lasts 30 minutes and each top cut round lasts 40.

#### Will tournaments be streamed?
Yes, one match from each round will be streamed. There will be a five-minute break before top cut.

#### How are disputes/issues resolved?
When in doubt, use <Mention>#helpdesk</Mention>. Optionally, you can use <Mention>#tourney-helpdesk</Mention> for tournament-related questions.

During the tournament, if there is a match dispute or any conflict, please use the smash.gg "Call a Moderator" feature.

You may also DM either Head Organiser about it.

#### How are teams balanced?
Teams are calculated based on your ranks, playstyle and previous competitive experience. All of these are converted into numerical values and then teams are created into drafts using code, and then balanced using human balancing.

#### What is Swiss?
Swiss is a bracket format, like Single Elimination or Round Robin. However, there are some things that set Swiss apart from other systems.

#### Am I able to scrim other teams competing in the tournament?
We're completely fine with you setting up scrims with other competing teams, in fact, we encourage it. Please be respectful!

#### Why organization spelled with an 's'?
This is an international server, some of us are part of Australia and EU, which spell certain words slightly differently, namely 'organisation'.

#### I need help using smash.gg, where can I get it?
If no staff is able to answer your question in <Mention>#helpdesk</Mention>, you can contact [smash.gg](https://help.smash.gg/) directly on their website or using their discord.

#### What is Weakest Link and when will it be returning?
Weakest Link is a tournament where three experience players are teamed up with one inexperienced solo player. These teams are assigned by Off the Dial and teams have one week to practice. This tournament currently is not supported with the current code we have and will require a lot more tweaking to be released. However, we do plan to have another Weakest Link, it just won't be for a long time.

#### I've heard some rumours about an Off the Dial Story Mode. What is this?
The Off the Dial Story Mode was a story driven, ARG tournament with the results impacting the next chapter of the story. This may return in the future, however for this to occur it requires several months of planning and preparation.

## It’s Dangerous to go Alone
#### What is It’s Dangerous to go Alone?
It’s Dangerous to go Alone is a tournament that sorts free agents into teams, and then those teams play each other until one is crowned victory! Teams are balanced based on a players ranks, play style and tournament experience.

#### What does IDTGA stand for?
IDTGA is our way of shortening It’s Dangerous to go Alone.

#### Is there a skill limit/cap?
No, we understand that if you don't have a team and want to experience a tournament you are not likely to be an X rank. Therefore we have no skill limit. Any player from C- to X can play in IDTGA.

#### How do 'tiered brackets' work?
Tiered brackets are our way of dividing up players so that they are teamed up (and play against) players that are closer to their skill range. This is quite similar to 'alpha' and 'beta' brackets you see in other large tournaments. However, where we differ is that the divide is by individual players, rather than by team. 

Players are divided into even groups based off their cumulative ELO (numerical score of all your ranks) and competitive experience. For example, if there were two brackets, the higher X rank players will be the higher bracket and the lower ranked players will be in the lower bracket. However, if over 50% of players are X rank, there will be some X rank players who will be in the lower bracket (and will be determined by their X rank power).

There must be a minimum of 16 teams (64 players) registered for tiered brackets to be used. This is because is so brackets are smaller than 8 teams per bracket.

#### Can I still play if I'm already on a team?
Even if you're already on a team you and your teammates can still play, just don't expect to be on the same team.

#### When do we receive our teams?
Teams are released 48 hours before the tournament starts. For the complete schedule, go to [otd.ink/idtga](https://otd.ink/idtga).

#### Why is check-in so early?
This check-in is different from the check-in before the tournament.

This is just so we can confirm you are playing before we sort players into teams. It is a way we minimise dropouts.

There is also a seperate check-in on smash.gg that happens right before each match starts, make sure you check in!

#### I'm on the list of 'Invalid Attendees - Only on smash.gg'. How can I fix this?

This is a list of smash.gg tags that have signed up on the smash.gg tournament page, but could not be traced back to any signup on otd.ink. If you're on this list, you will be removed from the tournament due to your signup being invalid, so it's important that you fix this.

The most common reason is that players will have signed up on the smash.gg page, however, they will fail to return back to [otd.ink](https://otd.ink) to complete the signup process. If you see that you do not have the "Signed Up!" role on discord, make sure you return back to the signup page to complete the signup, just scroll past the smash.gg section as you have completed that step already.

Another common reason is signing up with a different smash.gg account than the one that you have linked on your otd.ink profile. Make sure that the smash.gg user slug that you set on otd.ink points to the correct account, and that the account's smash.gg tag matches your smash.gg tag that is listed under invalid attendees.

#### Why is there also check-in for each match on smash.gg?

This is a feature we can't disable, but it's also a way to verify that you are attending your match. If you don't check in within 15 minutes of your match beginning you are automatically disqualified.

#### I’ve just finished a season of IDTGA, what do I do now?
If you’re playing in Swiss, make sure you've played all round, you aren't out if you lose!

If you didn’t make the finals, you can watch the rest of the stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/offthedial).

If you have any feedback on how we can improve the tournament in the future, please see [otd.ink/feedback](https://otd.ink/feedback).
