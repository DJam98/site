<Title title="FAQ">
  We get asked a lot of questions, so a FAQ necessary. You can find anything from "What is Signal Strength?" to "What is Swiss?".
</Title>

## General
#### What is my 'Signal Strength'?
Your Signal Strength is our internal way of calculating your tournament experience while being here on Off the Dial. It was introduced at the start of 2020. You gain signal strength based on the amount of tournaments and your placing in tournaments.

#### Why are the admins and TOs always chatting with everyone?
A happy server is a good server. We strive to make sure everyone is having a good time here and striking up conversations are a means to that end (and we also enjoy it).

#### What time do tournaments begin?
All tournaments begin on the same minute/hour, but due to timezones that time may differ. Daylight savings times have been listed as well.

Refer to your corresponding time-zone.

- `EST` 3pm Saturday
- `EDT` 4pm Saturday
- `GMT` 8pm Saturday
- `BST` 9pm Saturday
- `JST` 5am Sunday
- `AEST` 6am Sunday
- `AEDT` 7am Sunday

#### What time do tournaments end?
Tournaments usually last anywhere between 2 and 5 hours (generally around the four hour mark)

#### Will tournaments be streamed?
Yes! If there are at-least 4 teams, 1 match from each preliminary round will be streamed. There will be a five-minute break before the first finals match. All finals matches will be streamed as well.

#### How are disputes/issues resolved?
If you have any problems before the tournament, <Mention>#helpdesk</Mention> is the place to go. During the tournament we use smash.gg chat, if you have a dispute you can call a moderator directly on the website.

#### What is ELO?
In general, the ELO rating system is a way of calculating the relative skill levels of players. In our case, we calculate your in-game ELO when you enter your ranks and use it as one of the factors when balancing teams.

You can read more about ELO on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).

#### What is Swiss?
Swiss is a bracket format, like Single Elimination or Round Robin. However, there are some things that set Swiss apart from other systems. First of all, it's non-eliminating, meaning you play the same amount of rounds regardless of if you lose or not. Swiss pairs you up with people that are closest to the same win/loss record as you, making sure all rounds are as balanced as possible.

#### How are teams balanced?
Off the Dial Bot will assign players numerical values for all aspects of play. This includes ranks, play style and previous tournament experience.

#### Am I able to scrim other teams competing in the tournament?
Yes! We have no issue with you setting up a scrim with other competitors.

#### Why organization spelled with an 's'?
While this is an international server, the owner is Australian. So you may see many words are spelled differently outside of the United States, namely 'organisation'.

#### I want to share a cool moment from the previous tournament!
We regularly check [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Off_The_Dial) so free to use the hashtags [#idtga](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23idtga)) & [#wl](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23wl)), and mention [@Off_The_Dial](https://twitter.com/Off_the_Dial). :heart:

#### I have a question?
If you need help and it's not in here ask in <Mention>#helpdesk</Mention> and either one of the staff or another person will help. You can also DM us if you so choose.

#### I need help using smash.gg, where can I get it?
Assuming no one in helpdesk is able to help, you can contact [smash.gg](https://help.smash.gg/) directly through their website or on their [discord](https://discord.gg/smashgg).

## It’s Dangerous to go Alone

#### What is It’s Dangerous to go Alone?

It’s Dangerous to go Alone is a tournament that sorts free agents into teams, and then those teams play each other until one is crowned victory! Teams are balanced based on a players ranks, play style and tournament experience.

#### What does IDTGA stand for?

IDTGA is our way of shortening It’s Dangerous to go Alone.

#### Is there a skill limit/cap?

No, we understand that if you don't have a team and want to experience a tournament you are not likely to be an X rank. Therefore we have no skill limit. Any player from C- to X can play in IDTGA.

#### Can I still play if I'm already on a team?

Even if you're already on a team you and your teammates can still play, just don't expect to be on the same team.

#### When do we receive our teams?

Teams are released 24 hours before the tournament commences.

#### Why is check-in so early?

This is so we can confirm you are playing before we sort players into teams. It is a way we minimise dropouts.

#### Why is there also check-in for each match on smash.gg?

This is a setting that comes default with smash.gg and there is no way to disable it, so make sure you check in for every match you play!

#### What is the IDTGA league?

So we have a simple leaderboard for players who often play in the tournament and to group the tournaments on a single page.

#### I’ve just finished a season of IDTGA, what do I do now?

If you’re playing in Swiss or Round Robin, make sure that all your rounds are completed. If you didn’t make the finals feel free to watch the rest of the stream on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/offthedial). Shortly after the tournament finishes, a feedback forum will be released. We would appreciate it if you gave honest feedback that can improve the next season.

## Weakest Link

#### What is Weakest Link?

Weakest link is a unique, Off the Dial exclusive, tournament featuring both teams and free agents! Sign up as a 3 player team and get paired up with a lone FA.

#### Is there a skill limit/cap?

There is a skill limit for teams, and there is a skill cap for players, if you are a FA above the skill cap, you can create a pickup team, if you are a team below the skill limit, you can sign up as a FA instead.

## Off the Dial Bot

#### What is Off the Dial Bot?

Off the Dial Bot is a custom built bot by LeptoFlare, It provides many commands that help us run tournaments more smoothly. You can find a page regarding the bot [here](bot).

#### Is Off the Dial Bot open-sourced?

Yes! You can find all the code on [Github](https://github.com/LeptoFlare/offthedialbot).

#### I have a suggestion/bug report for Off the Dial Bot.

I'd love it if you made a Github Issue using [this link](https://github.com/LeptoFlare/offthedialbot/issues/new/choose). This lets us track all of the suggestions and reports permanently in one place, as opposed to the suggestions channel, where the messages can get easily lost.
