Hi! I’m one of the current head TOs for Off the Dial. 

I try to help where I can, whether it be streaming, commentating, or day-of business. I run the Special Series on Off the Dial, where I run an off-the-walls idea and turn that into a little bit of fun for everyone.

I am a former Nautilus 79 main and I played for RIOT before its disbandment after LUTI 11. I stream and play VALORANT whenever I’m home, but usually I’m writing papers and studying for exams for college.

If you’re interested, please check out my Twitter and Twitch! Follows are greatly appreciated and I hope to see you in a tourney!
