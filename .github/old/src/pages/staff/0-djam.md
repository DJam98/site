Hey there! I'm DJam98 and I am the creator of this little Discord
server on the internet.

I spend most of my spare time on Off the Dial and playing games on
the Switch (and spending way too much time in Splatoon).

I have a Twitch and Twitter, if you want to check that out, I would greatly appricate that! I stream a lot of Splatoon, but also a bunch of other games. Or as I like to say at the start of every stream "I'm a TO, streamer, commentator, and whatever I feel like doing!".
