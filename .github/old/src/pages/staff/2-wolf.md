Hi I'm Wolf! I'm one of the Staff in Off the Dial.

I'm a Splatoon enjoyer who plays way too much of it but I also enjoy playing other games both on the Switch and PC.

Also a Kensa Splattershot Pro and Dapple Dualies Nouveau player but I love messing about with other weapons

I also have a Twitter for posting clips and Twitch where I stream league and other stuff
