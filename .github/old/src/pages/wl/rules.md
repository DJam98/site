## Subs

3-player teams can sign up with an extra player on their team (4 players total). This player cannot substitute for the Weakest Link.

If your FA is consistently unable to practice in-game, you can request 1 replacement 3 days after teams are released, up to 24 hours before tournament day.
There is no guaranteed your request will be fulfilled.

After this point, If your FA is unavailable, an emergency sub is not allowed and you will be forced to forfeit.

If a FA has requested to replace your team, your team will be removed from the tournament and marked as a dropout (See **[Dropouts](#dropouts)**).

### As a FA
If there are more FA’s than teams, extra FA’s will be marked as FA subs and may be assigned to teams up to 24 hours before tournament day.

If your team is consistently acting disrespectful towards you, you can request 1 replacement 3 days after teams are released, up to 24 hours before tournament day. There is no guaranteed your request will be fulfilled.

If a team has requested to replace you, you will be removed from the tournament and marked as a dropout (See **[Dropouts](#dropouts)**).


## DC's Redo Decision Rules
### Redo the match if:
- The team with the DC stops playing and allows the other team to KO.
- The team with the DC stays inside their spawn barrier.
- Both teams use the same weapons/gear shown on the results screen.

### Do NOT redo the match if:
- **Any player** on the same team DC's again the same round.
- The host DCs.
- The match has passed `2:30` before the DC'ing team has forfeited.
- Either team has `50` or less objective remaining (excluding penalty).

If either 2 DCs occur in the same lobby or the host DCs, the team currently not hosting must host the new lobby.

To reduce the chances of a dc happening, please check you have a good internet connection with low ping and/or have a LAN adapter for a smoother experience. If not, consider switching hosts.

### Lag

If there's are complaints about lag from at least 3 people on the same team or 1 person from each team, teams are required to switch hosts to someone on the opposing team.

## Dropouts
For everyone's sake, ***please*** do not drop out.

A dropout occurs when either the Weakest Link or the 3-player team (as a whole) refuses to play after teams are created, for whatever reason.

### If you dropout:
- You will not be able to play in the Off the Dial tournament.
- You will not receive any Signal Strength for the tournament.

### If the FA/team you are paired with drops out:
- Unfortunately, due to the nature of this tournament, you will not be able to compete anymore.

## Permitted Weapons and Gear
- All weapons and variations are allowed
- All gear purchased in game (with some exclusions)
- Any gear that is considered 'hacked gear' is not allowed. This is any gear that can't be obtained by normal means within the game. This includes having gear exclusive abilities, having brand favoured abilities as the main ability. No matter how the gear was obtained, it is not permitted. One warning will be given, if player continues they will be disqualified from the tournament.
