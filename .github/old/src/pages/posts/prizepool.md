# The Prize Pool.... pool
- The Prize Pool will have a starting balance of $40 United States Dollars (USD). 
- Once there are 64 registered players, another $40 USD will be added to the Prize Pool (for a total of $80 USD). Additionally, this will create a new bracket that will operate independently of the original bracket and the prize pool will be split based on the Prize Pool Distributions stated lower on this document. 
- Once another 64 players have registered to the tournament (totalling 128 players) another $40 USD will be added to the Prize Pool (totalling $120 USD). Additionally, this will create a new bracket that will operate independently of the original bracket and the second bracket, and the prize pool will be split based on the Prize Pool Distributions stated lower on this document. 
- Anyone may contribute to the Prize Pool (Patrons). This may be done at the PayPal Donate Page to <Mention>DJam98</Mention> by accessing the redirect link [otd.ink/prizepool](https://otd.ink/prizepool), or by becoming a Patreon on Off the Dial's Patreon page at [otd.ink/patreon](https://otd.ink/patreon). Note that a **Patron** is anyone who is donating to the prize pool and a **Patreon** is anyone who contributes through Patreon's website. A Patreon is a Patron, however not vice-versa.
- If a Patron contributes to the Prize Pool it is NON-REFUNDABLE, and does not count as a contribution/donation to a charity, not-for-profit or equivalent organisation or entity for the purposes of tax and other legal applications.
- If a Patron contributes to the Prize Pool, their donation may incur fees or taxes. Off the Dial will not compensate this money. Instead, it will be taken out of each donation made or charged to the Patron, however this will vary depending on the method of payment and platform of payment.

# Prize Pool Distribution

The Prize Pool will be distributed using the following methods:

**Distribution Across Brackets**
- If there is one bracket of players, 100% of the Prize Pool will go to that bracket
- If there are two brackets of players, 60% of the Prize Pool will go to the upper bracket, and the remaining 40% will go to the lower bracket
- If there are three brackets of players, 50% of the Prize Pool will go the highest bracket, 30% will go to the middle bracket, and the remaining 20% will go to the lowest bracket.

**Distribution Within Brackets**

This will apply to all brackets
- 50% will go the the team that placed 1st in the bracket
- 30% will go to the team that placed 2nd in the bracket
- 20% will go to the team that placed 3rd in the bracket
> For this season ONLY, there will be a 3rd place match played in the top cut.

**Distribution Within Teams**
- All eligible players will receive an even split of the team's winnings.

# Method of Distribution
- For legal reasons, if a player wins money from the prize pool they will receive this money in the form of a gift card. By default, this will be an Amazon Gift Card, however this can be requested to be changed once players have been contacted about their prize. If a player wishes to receive a gift card that is not from Amazon, it must be purchasable by <Mention>@DJam98</Mention>. Additionally, if the desired gift card only is purchasable in certain increments (rather than a custom amount), the player will receive the gift card that is within their winnings. The remaining funds will then remain with Off the Dial and players will not receive the rest of this money. Players can only receive one gift card.
- Players who can receive a prize will be initially contacted through Discord by <Mention>@DJam98</Mention>. If after 1 week of the initial message being sent there has been no response, they will be contacted through their email linked to the smash.gg account, or if there is none linked, they will be contacted again on Discord. If after 2 weeks of this second attempt there has been no response, the money will go back to Off the Dial and will no longer be available to the player.

# Laws and Legislations
- Laws and Legislations will follow the ones that govern Victoria, Australia.
- This Prize Pool is declared as a Trade Promotion Lottery as there is no entry fee for participants.
