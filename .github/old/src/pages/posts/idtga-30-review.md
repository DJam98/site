Another season in that now lies in the record books, but that means it's time to give it a review and have a look at your feedback!

Before we go into this session of feedback review, we'd just like to point out that it's not up to us if you have a clash with another tournament during IDTGA. We let you guys know when the tournament will occur at least two weeks in advance, which is plenty of time to decide whether or not you'd like to play. And if you want my personal opinion - I would never do more than one tournament per day, given how much energy even just one tournament can take out of you.

Obviously we like to avoid clashes with other tournaments but there's only so much we can do. We have several staff members that don't just help run Off the Dial but are also running everything behind the scenes with both IPL and Dapple (both of which had tournaments during the previous season of IDTGA), so we like to avoid each other where possible, but we all have our own schedules - and there are only so many weekends in a month.

So please, schedule your time wisely.

Now, onto the feedback!

## Feedback Discusion
*Add an option for voice chat and how likely you are to drop from the tournament.*
> While yes, we can always add on extra parts onto the form, I don't see how this will impact team creation. With having a voice chat option, you can't form teams based on if you want to voice chat or not. People all have their own privacy that they would like to keep online and we will always respect this. Having the option of voice chat, while advantageous, does not impact a player's technical skill. And then with how likely you are to dropout, again, what are we going to do with this information? Regardless of if we know you are going to dropout or not the process remains exactly the same. In both circumstances, all we can do is hope that subs signup.

*Honestly, I think everything went pretty well, no changes from me, I had a pretty good time!*
> That's great to hear, and I hope to see you again in future tournaments!

*This tourney clashed with Low Ink Day 1, causing some players to not attend their first rounds in time. If the tourney date was changed to an earlier or a later one, it would be much less of a hassle for players planning their schedules. But again, it comes down to the player's judgement as well.*
> As discussed earlier, it is not up to us whether or not players have clashes with other tournaments.

*Some teams had like 2x and s+ as we had two really low x one s to s+ and an a*
> Teams are impossible to make perfect, and there are also a multiple other values that go into making teams beyond your solo q ranks. This includes playstyles, competive experience, signal strength, and timezones. Also, they were likely low X rank as well based on what I can see from the teams list.

*Something that I could just have accidentally skipped over- but how long waiting until taking a match then the set wasn’t shown on the rules on the website, but like I said I could’ve just skipped it. Y’all did great with the chaos of players trying to balance low ink and IDTGA however, so good job on that!*
> It's great to hear you enjoyed the tournament, and yes it does seem you might of missed it - it is under the round duration section. Make sure you're on the right page as well at [otd.ink/idtga/rules](https://otd.ink/idtga/rules).

*If you could announce teams a couple days earlier so that proper practice could be done, it'd help a lot with teams of multiple timezones! Other than that it was great!*
> We try to give you guys as much time as possible, while having registration being open as late as possible so we can as many registrations as possible. We'll take a look at this in future seasons so thank you for the insight!
