# Off the Dial Bot
> A custom made bot, it's built from the ground up by [LeptoFlare](https://lepto.tech) and used for all kinds of stuff, tournament management, profile storage, and generating minesweepers at your convenience.

Some commands to get you started:
- Use `$profile create` to create your profile so you don't have to create one when you sign up for a tournament.
- Use `$flairme <flair>` to give yourself roles surrounding things you would like to get notified for things.

For assistance, you can use `$help`. You can also add help to the beginning of any command for more specific help.

The bot is open sourced, so if you would like to contibute, you can find all the source code [here](https://github.com/offthedial/bot).
