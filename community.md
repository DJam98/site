# Community
Off the Dial is thankful to have such an awesome team and community of @Moderators, including @Streamers & @Organisers! They are a crucial part of Off the Dial and the server would not be where it is today without them. Each person in the community also has their own unique skills and backgrounds. If you want to learn more about them, or if they interest you, you can check each one of them out, right here!

### DJam98
> *Owner & Twitter Addict* - **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/djam987)**

Hey there! I'm DJam98 and I am the creator of this little discord server on the internet. I spend most of my spare time on Off the Dial and playing games on the Switch (and spending way too much time in Splatoon), but I do have a twitter if you want to check that out, follows appreciated! I also sometimes post upcoming updates that may be coming to the server and tournaments.

### LeptoFlare
> *Bot Developer & Open Source Supporter* - **[Website](https://lepto.tech)**

You may know Lepto as Off the Dial bot's new maintainer, or his latest announcement to rewrite it open sourced. Lepto's important role of creating the bot has saved me alot of headaches and made it much easier to track ranks, manage profiles, and generate minesweepers at your convenience! He is a junior software engineer who plans to contribute to the open source movement and have some fun in the process! If you are into programming, open source, or want to learn about them, I suggest you check Lepto out! There are also support channels for if you ever need any help. Whether it be using Lepto's software, developing on it, or even just programming in general!

### Zada
> *Commentator/Streamer & World Traveler* - **[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/zadafrex)**

Zada is a recent addition to the commentary team at Off the Dial. He's been streaming since 2018 and hosts a weekly on-stream 1v1 Splatoon tournament. In the last two years he has participated in several Splatoon LANs around the United States. Outside of streaming Splatoon and a few other Nintendo Switch games, Zada serves on two boards of directors and works full-time as an information technology manager.

### Sauce
> *Commentator/Streamer & Food Junkie* - **[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/saucesplatoon)**

Sauce is a resident hypeman that wishes one day the Kensa Rapid Blaster will have it's time in the limelight. He tries hard to keep his S+X rank during his streams, but never actually finishes his placements. Also, Sauce streamed a large portion of the broadcasts for the Off the Dial in the past. He also tends to have an obsession over anything that may and could be considered a sauce... Other than Splatoon, Sauce is trying to explore the growing Esports industry and hopes that career choice takes flight!

### Frosty (SBPC)
> *Moderator & Club Owner* - **[Discord](https://discord.gg/Y4kzHrt)**

Outside of being the hibernate moderator, Frosty is a developer of community projects across multiple nintendo games! He was one of the two members to commentate Off The Dial's first stream way back during IDTGA 4, and has since been a part of the team. Currently, he runs a pickup club named The 7/11 in his personal server, where Free Agents and people with teams alike can join and get teams for pickups of all kind!
