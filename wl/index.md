# Weakest Link
<u>Weakest Link</u> is a unique, Off the Dial exclusive, free agent **and** team tournament for Splatoon 2! Sign up as a 3-player team or a lone free agent, and we will pair each team to each link. This tournament provides the opportunity for free agents to get coaching experience in a team setting, and for teams to test their communication and teaching skills.

All you need to do is sign up! The world is waiting…

## Registration
There are 2 ways to register, either as an FA (free agent), or a 3-player team.

### Registering as a 3-player team
- Each member of your team must have at least 1 X rank.

  If your team does not meet these requirements, each member of your team can sign up as an individual FA.

### Registering as an FA (the Weakest Link)
- FA’s have a skill ceiling of no X ranks.

  If your rank is too high, you can create a pickup team. Pickups can be formed in the `#build-a-team` channel or any of the pickup channels/servers listed on the [Inkademy](https://discord.io/inkademy) discord server.

Exceptions can be made! Contact the TO’s for more details.

If you are unsure of what category you are, contact one of the Organisers and we’ll sort you out.

To register, simply enter `$signup` in `#bot-commands` on [Discord](https://otd.ink/discord)! The bot will guide you through the complete process. If you have any questions or issues with the bot, feel free to ask in `#helpdesk`.
